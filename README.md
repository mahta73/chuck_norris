##   Project description and infromation about the website
As we all love Chuck Norris and jokes about him, we will create an application to visualize jokes about him.
	Our website has 3 sections: Header section, Random joke section and Search joke section.
	Header contains logo(Chuck Norris’s specific logo) and title “Everyone loves Chuck Norris”
	Random joke section: There is a dropdown fulfilled with joke categories. If no category is selected, select first one by default. When category is selected, show random joke for that category.
	Search joke section: There is an input field, by default it shows some placeholder. When user fills some text and clicks enter, show list of search results for given search word. When no results are found, show “No results” text instead of list.
